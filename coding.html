					<h2>How have I Grown in Coding?</h2>
						<p> So far in coding I have learned, java, css, and sanscript. I am planning on learning Python, but until them here is a little bit of things I have learned along my path. </p>
						<a href="coding.html">
								<div class="fakeimg37" style="height:500px;"></div>
							</a>
						<p>One of the things that help me a lot throughout coding is elements and tags, which are useful coding to make the website look better and looks more professional.</p>
						<ul>
						<li>The <em>div<em> tag helps you organize everything in the div tag to stay all together instead of being place random. It's used to keep the about me to the right on this page. It also helps with keeping the class and id elements together which are my next two.</li>
						<li>The class element helps you in your css for if you want all one sized text to be one color you can make everything in the div - class - h1 to be all grey text, you could.</li>
						<li>h1 is a good tag to use because it is a title text for the webpage, which is the beggest you can have a html size of text go with going biggest to smallest. h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 are sizes of text you can use.</li>
						<li>The id element is a great thing to use because it helps when identifying a certain tag to use so if you want just your title to be red text you could put id - title to turn it red with the help of css by adding a . to the begginning of want you want example .title { color:red; }</li>
						<li>Another great tag to use is the ul tag because it makes a unordered list for you to list things not in order just like this list.</li>
						</ul>
