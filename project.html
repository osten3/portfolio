				<h1>How I Grew at the Dayton Regional STEM School</h1>
					<h3>Throughout my time at at the Dayton Regional STEM School I got to learn a lot more than I thought I did. Every year we had to reflect on what we did and I have created pages for each of my years on what I did. Above you can choose what grade you would like to see how I have grown over all these years.</h3>

					<h2>What do we do at the Dayton Regional STEM School?</h>
					<h3>What is PBL?</h3>
					<p> PBL is something we call project base learning. We use this so we can learn more in a productive way at school. As in projects we work most of the time in groups to complete a project. It saves time and we learn more by getting it done. PBL is something that we used up until 12th grade. </p>
					<h2> What is Genius Hour?</h2>
					<p> Genius Hour is a project of where we research a question we have and find information on it. Since I am big in music I created a page explaining my theory of music.</p>
