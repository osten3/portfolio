					<h2>Going into 9th Grade</h2>
						<p>I know a lot more in general about the things that we are learning from when I stated 9th grade until now, so I think I am ready for 10th grade. I thought it was going to be very different from 8th grade when I first came into 9th grade, but as time went, I realized that it was not that different, which I did not expect. The good thing about our school is that we know everyone that we will be with and the community is the same. That helps me ask questions more often so I am not lost. I have grown in several ways but important ways I think I developed is in time management and better organizing. I feel better when I know what is going on before I do it, so I started working on my time management. I know that high school was going to be harder, so I planned what I needed to turned in so I do not fall behind. I care a lot more about what I am doing in school now then I was going into 9th grade. </p>

					<h2>Me Excelling in 9th Grade</h2>
					<!-- FINISHED -->
						<p>Excelling is a way of showing forms of growth in significant ways or ways that will benefit someone in the future. In one of my Engineering projects, we used Inventor, an online program to make 3D designs. The succeeding moment in this project was when I created a stamp. I had to decide on how to get the words in the right way, so the stamp would 3D print without failure. I had to dig deep into researching, a way to make my idea possible in order to make it pleasing and meet the requirements. The first picture of the stamp shows how I had troubles during the project using Inventor. The second picture shows the finale of the stamp. This project made me use persistence to get the answer and finish the project. This project helped me excel in ways I usually do not do. </p>

					<h2>How I Struggled in 9th Grade</h2>
						<p> In History, I was having many problems with the museum project and how to manage the project. We used unreal during the project to create a 3D museum. Unreal is a program that enables people to code to make an in game design. It was a new program that needed a bunch of tutorials to develop a 3D museum. Even though we had several weeks to work on the design, I had some challenges when building the museum. I overcame that struggle by designing the project and by doing a deep description of what you would see the museum. The picture below is explaining what it looked like and how I was able to manage through unreal.  The second picture shows the tutorial when you first learn the basics. I am reflecting on this because of being a struggle for me as I went out of my comfort zone and did what I needed to do. I used persistence to accomplish the History Museum.</p>

					<h2>My Greatest Growth</h2>
						<p>The Short story that I created in Language Arts gave me more acknowledged English and why it's a course in high school. I have obtained a lot of knowledge in Language arts than I have before. Even though I have had dilemmas with language arts before, that's why this is my greatest growth. There is one project in particular that greatly impacted my life. I have read (Alas, Babylon), and the writing of fiction (my apocalyptic short story). Producing these characters implied a big challenge, forgetting to grasp my characters, majorly affected my grade. Tying each of the characters together toward a direction that you could not in real life but enough to make it realistic. The first artifact that I have is a link that shows the finale. The second artifact shows my first draft was of the story. Throughout the planning of my short story, I found it transcending to see my completion in the story. Making the right quantity of words to fit the requirements, making sure that it was understandable, and showing emotion was more arduous than I would imagine.  </p>

					<h2>Going into 10th Grade</h2>
						<p> I am ready for 10th grade because I have change in a way where I see my self-successful in the future. Persistence I had to rely on the most in 9th Grade. I am ready for 10th grade because I didnâ€™t do so bad the first year of high school and people say it gets easier the more you get closer to college. Being focused on being organized. I want to become better at introducing myself as a person and being able to present in a professional way. I would like to learn more in general.</p>
