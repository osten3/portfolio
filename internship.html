					<h2> My internship page includes my May, 2020 Internship with Amanda Byers, Dayton Chamber of Commerce President (Former Beavercreek Chamber of Commerce President.)</h2>
					<h3>Day 1 (Chamber of Commerce?)</h3>
					<h5> 4 Hours</h5>
					<p>On the first day with the Chamber, Mrs. Byers told me the basics of working in the community and city and what commerce does. Throughout the rest of the day, I took notes on what happened regularly in the chamber, and I got to work with the people. Meeting business members, filing checks and receipts, and some things that aren't to be seen by the public. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg41" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 2 (Board Meeting)</h3>
					<h5> 6 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the second day, I met the twelve board members for the chamber. Each member had a different role than they gained when joining the chamber. (The chamber of commerce is a community board to allow residents of that city to help maintain the city's upkeep and bring people together. Usually co-helping new businesses and city development.) Some things will not be said, as a lot of information is confidential. The board members planned the 4th of July parade, golf outings for the city representative, and some new members coming into the commerce.  </p>
					<div class="fakeimg42" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 3 (Virtual Meeting)</h3>
					<h5>4 hours </h5>
					<p>On the third day, I got to watch the Washington D.C. Chamber of Commerce meeting, which included most of the active chambers in the country. Mrs. Byers took in some information about what the head president of the chamber is doing and what the Beavercreek chamber could do better. Then we went over the basics of what security goes on behind the chamber and what I cannot see. I was an intern, so I learned a little more than the average. When working with business and the people idea's together, it can become a struggle. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg43" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 4 (Visiting with Bea)</h3>
					<h5> 8 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the fourth day, I learned who Bea is! Bea is a little beaver (A stuffed animal to make it cute.) that travels around the city helping members and businesses so the board members can get a better idea of the cities needs. We would take a picture of Bea around a city gem and post it on Facebook to see if people knew. People would win prizes for guessing right! This taught me a lot more than some people would think. Bringing the community together and bringing people closer to little businesses to help the city out and create a good look. This also helps the chamber get around to all the businesses they are partnered with throughout the city. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg44" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 5 (Planning City Events)</h3>
					<h5>8 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the fifth day, I got to be a part of city planning. Closer into detail, I got to work with Beavercreek officials that were working on the highway (35) that goes through Dayton to xenia. While talking about the plans, I learned that there was no way to fix the 3 lights on the highway. I learned how hard it is for people to change the way they live when it comes to road work. To this day they have implemented a different way, but there is still lights and people like semi drivers still hate this highway. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg45" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 6 (Fairfeild Garden)</h3>
					<h5> 10 Hours </h5>
					<p> On the sixth, I got to go to a ribbon-cutting for the new garden at the Fairfield Mall. This is a community garden designed to help make the mall seem greener and more of a community local mall. This was a great experience as I got to talk to many officials, got to be a part of an official ribbon cutting, and got to see the introduction to the start of something new. I even got to hold those big scissors, and yes they are 100% real and could hurt someone.  </p>
					<div class="fakeimg46" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 7 (Buiness Meeting)</h3>
					<h5> 10 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the seventh day, I was in a meeting with a new arising company in the Dayton area. This company wanted to introduce its water softener company to Beavercreek. They got together with the Beavercreek chamber of commerce and presented to all the board members their idea of water Beavercreek could look like, what they have already done, and what could be improved. I got to see a hand-to-hand presentation, meet business people around the Dayton area, and seek different presentation skills that I haven't learned at school. Putting myself through a real business presentation made me feel closer to what goes on in real life.</p>
					<div class="fakeimg47" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 8 (Networking Event)</h3>
					<h5> 10 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the eighth day, I was working with the chamber at a networking event. This networking event is held, getting all of the business owners in the city to get together and talk with each other. This is an extremely long event, but I used this to talk to some people around Beavercreek and get to know them. Overall a great experience as I learned more about my city, and the community. Getting closer to that was an honor and I would do it again. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg48" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 9 (Library Visit)</h3>
					<h5> 6 Hours </h5>
					<p> On the ninth day, I went to visit the Beavercreek library. During this visit, we talked about how the library was doing during the pandemic. We got to check out some books and then we got to have a little behind the scenes with "Bea" and take a little photo shoot. Some pictures I can't share because they aren't mine. </p>
					<div class="fakeimg49" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					<h3>Day 10 (Hilton Head Visit)</h3>
					<h5> 6 Hours </h5>
					<p>On the tenth day, I got to visit the Beavercreek Hilton Garden Inn. This was a real-life experience that I will never forget. During my internship, people were still recovering from covid and I got to see the business side of effects this had. For instance, they were losing employees, losing money, and losing customers. After just redoing the place right before covid, they went down in sales instead of the other way around. I got to see the design of the place and behind the scenes of what they do in these situations.</p>
					<div class="fakeimg50" height="1000px" width="200px" ></div>
					
					<h2> Reflection and Evaluation </h2>
					<p> My internship with Mrs. Byers has been a wonderful experience. I adventured many places in my hometown, and I got to be a part of many meetings and professional groups. I got to be a part of a ribbon-cutting, and I got to see more into my community. I got to understand certain levels of business, what businesses have to do to gain popularity and be successful, how I can grow a business, and what I need to do to start one. </p>

					<p>My main struggle was how piety and stubborn some business people are. As blunt as that sounds, it's true. Everyone is different, but some people won't have things unless they're their way. People complain about giving small amounts of money towards something, or even what food is at a community event. I realized that not everything is simple and easy. You have to look into the ethics of every decision. When it comes to the community of a large group, you have to think real hard. Either way, someone will get mad, sad, or just unhappy. There is nothing you can do about it. You have to think about what will make the majority happy and leave the past behind you. I have to say it gave me a better perspective on business ethics. Later in my senior year, I worked hand to hand with environmental engineering ethics. I learned how this is something we do in our everyday lives. (Not to a business extent, but just small everyday situations.) Now I know why business people are so realistic. It allows them to take a stance behind something. Thinking towards the best ethic makes them secure their opinion. I can also see why people decide to do things that benefit them rather than others. It's not like you want to put people down, but you need to put yourself out there to get yourself where you want to be. </p>

					<p>Intellectually I learned how to run a business. Not overall, but little things that can make a difference. I saw how business professionals took the opportunity to talk to certain people or stand behind something. I got to see how business professionals looked at things from a different perspective. I saw how professionals would take meetings, minutes, and other notes at certain times. I learned how people think surrounding money and actions they need to take. I grasped people skills by interacting with high intelligence people and saw how they reacted towards different things. I got to experience obstacles that people faced. For example: losing customers or not having enough jobs. What a great experience for me, as everyone was still recovering from covid, and I got to see the effects for myself. Not for the businesses because they were all struggling financially and physically as some managers had to work extended hours. These problems were crazy, so they asked the city for help. I got to be a part of that, and it was very uplifting to know businesses can always get help. Later in my internship, I learned how being a part of something business-wise will always make you look good. I used this opportunity to push forth the passion I have.</p>

					<p>This opportunity from the Beavercreek Chamber has me looking into my profession and what I will do with a computer science degree. I want to be a part of or create my own business surrounding computers. This internship encouraged me to pursue this dream and has given me more experience. Some of my peers decided to experience their actual college field, but I decided to go out of the way and learn something new. What I want to do in the future is clear, as I now know how to start my journey through the end of high school. I want to start by getting a computer science or information science degree. Maybe start my own business and hopefully, remember these skills by then. </p>

					<p>Overall, I would say this experience was one to remember. I had tons of fun and learned more about what I intended to learn. I took every opportunity I could get and saw the best of them. I learned more about the business side of things and took this to heart. I want to create a business one day and receiving this knowledge made me more confident about what I want to do. I will take this experience to college and hope I will be able to continue my dream past high school.</p>
