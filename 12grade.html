					<h2>Greatest Growth</h2>
								<h3>I am a challenge-seeking student that wants to pursue my passion towards a business of my own regarding computer science, computer hardware, or cyber security. Coming from a STEM school and taking 6 High school classes, 3 enginnering and 3 computer science, has helped me become more aware of what Iâ€™m passionate about and what I want to do in the future. Some of my greatest growth through these experiences are my coding ablities. At the start of six grade, I knew coding exsisted, but didn't know how to code. Since then I have learned java, sanscript, CSS, and am learning Python. Using these I have created this portfolio and look forward to growing a business of my own surrounding this one day.</h3>

							<h2>What have I done outside of school this year?</h2>
								<p>Since we don't have school sports at the Dayton Regional STEM School, I have to go to my local school to try out for any sports. At the Beavercreek Highschool I made the varsity track team for hurtles. Though this was a tough time because I injured myself 2 days before we has meets. I ended up getting minor stress fractures in both my legs. Since then I have been recovering and working myself back up to track.  </p>

They club is full of fun people and I really enjoy spending time with the club, but due to Coivd-19 I decided to wait until my senior year to come back to Key Club. Can't wait to do it again!</p>
