					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
								<p>I am a challenge-seeking student that wants to pursue my passion towards a business of my own regarding computer science, computer hardware, or cyber security. Coming from a STEM school and taking 6 High school classes, 3 enginnering and 3 computer science, has helped me become more aware of what Iâ€™m passionate about and what I want to do in the future. At the start of six grade, I didn't know what I wanted to do in the engineering feild, so I started messing around with a lot of different paths. Starting off in sixth grade, I was coding using html and css. Later on twoards the end of middle school, I was able to presentate to a group of people with just my coding skills. Going into high school I started exploring other types of engineering, like 3d-printing, environmetnal engineering, game design, cyber security, computer hardware, and a lot more. </p>
					<h2>Greatest Growth</h2>
								<p>Through my engineering education, experiences, and challenges, I caught myself capable of solving real-world problems. Using these engineering skills, I have created this portfolio, and I plan on growing a business surrounding engineering in the future.</p>
								<p> Overall, I would like to see myself create a engineering based company, either through computer design, computer hardware, or software, or a cyber security network. I would like to do this in the future because it's a dream of mine to follow my granfathers footsteps. I could finally support the community like my grandparents which gave to the Airforce, Military, and Government. My Mothers' dad sold the C-17 (One of the extensive planes in the world.) to the Air force, my dads' father served in Vietnam and then became an Electrical Engineer, my great-grandfather served in World War II, and my grandmother sold over a hundred F-16s' to the Israeli government. Below are a few examples on how I am currently working twoards these goals.</p>

					<h2>Coding</h2>
					<p>Overall, coding has been something very valued to me growing up. As a 6th grader, we started coding with HTML and CSS. As a twelve-year-old, coding was an extended amount of work and took patience. You have to make sure everything is perfect, or the whole website won't upload properly. Although once you get past this point and manage to get used to it, I found a way to express my creativity and how I would like to present myself. Without this portfolio, I wouldn't be able to show people what I was capable of, and now I can look back on this. Through the years, I have worked with java, CSS, and Sans Script to fully make this portfolio. I wouldn't have been able to do it with my dedication to engineering. A nice experience as I got to figure out what I wanted to do, and I had to ask myself a lot of questions on the way. </p>

					<h2>Making my Portfolio Unique</h2>
					<p>As you can see, my portfolio is a lot different from others. In 7th grade, they gave us a template to work off just using HTML and CSS. Disliking the template they gave us for the portfolio, I created something better. The summer before my 9th-grade year, I worked almost every day on my portfolio to get the design I wanted. I came up with a new design surrounding the idea of java. Adding this gave me a lot more opportunities to use my creativeness. Adding java was a great way to expand my knowledge of computer science as today it is still my most favorited type of engineering. I will further educate myself through computer science and programming, and hopefully. I want to receive a computer science degree, and this experience has helped me learn what I want to do. </p>

					<h2>3D Printing</h2>
					<p> In 9th grade, I created something for my mother. She had just become a flight attendant, and I would surprise her with a Christmas gift. The gift I invented was a stamp that was 3d printed using Inventor. The project went overall well other than the words. Sadly, Inventor only lets you put words forwards. I ended up figuring this out, where I created each letter myself. Twenty-four hours I worked on letters that ended up being small, detail by detail. Overall, I learned that I should take my creativity and patience somewhere else, as 3d printing is a very long process. This is a small process to figuring out what engineering pathway I wanted to take. </p>

					<h2>Environmental Engineering</h2>
					<p>I am currently in an environmental engineering class that studies ethics, pollution, and bioengineering. One of my most favorite classes as I get to see how engineering is applied to the real world while making the world a better place. My most recent project is working with environmental sustainability and figuring out how our world works with problems. The most recent discussion was about carbon monoxide poisoning and how winter affects this. We use our heaters during the winter, creating more carbon monoxide. However, carbon monoxide is good for us, but too much could lead to death. Through my studies, I learned the ethics of this conversation and what could be improved. I got to experience how other people react to specific problems. I took this and learned about how we incorporate engineering into other parts other than computers and mechanics. I got to enjoy this class, and I plan on taking a class similar in college. </p>

					<h2>Unreal, and Game Design<h2>
					<p> During my 9th grade year, I designed a 3D game using Unreal. Unreal has created numerous games including, today's famous Fortnite. Unreal didn't use coding to perform actions and was pretty simple. Due to an unfortunate event, I lost my files and lost everything. I had to recreate my digital design in words. Speaking 3d art through words is hard, and I will never do it again. I used my inquiry skills throughout this explanation of my art room because I had to keep getting other people's perspectives on the writing. The piece was in a 3rd perspective, and for me, it was brutal to write as I imagined art through 1st person. What a learning experience, as I used engineering to the writing level which, interested me. I got to understand what somebody doesn't. Saying how writing in engineering is a good thing to learn as others may not understand what your going through. Overall, this was a big success for me, and I will carry it through to college. </p>

							<h2>What have I done outside of school this year?</h2>
								<p>Since we don't have school sports at the Dayton Regional STEM School, I have to go to my local school to try out for any sports. At the Beavercreek Highschool I made the varsity track team for hurtles. Though this was a tough time because I injured myself 2 days before we has meets. I ended up getting minor stress fractures in both my legs. Since then I have been recovering and working myself back up to track.  </p>

							<h2>What Happened to Key Club?</h2>
								<p>Due to Covid-19, I didn't want to partipate in Key Club. Key Club is a Club in the Dayton Regional STEM School to help out the school, community and places all over the world. They club is full of fun people and I really enjoy spending time with the club, but due to Coivd-19 I decided to wait until my senior year to come back to Key Club. Can't wait to do it again!</p>

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>			
					<div class="fakeimg27" style="height:400px;" ></div>
					<p>I love traveling the World! I go on many trips to different countries and have visited most of the States. One of my most favorite places to go was New York City! I got to go see the One World Trade Center. It is the second tallest building in North America, and the Tallest in the United States. </p>

							<h2>How can Music affect someones Daily Life?</h2>
								<p>The reason I chose this Driving Question is because I have put most of my life time into music, and it has imapcted my life more than anyone I know. Music has been a passion and i've always wondered about the secrets behind it.</p>
