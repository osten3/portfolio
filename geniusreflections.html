						<h3>Genius Hour Reflection</h3>
<p>In my genius hour project I was struggling with working with coding. So getting my things organized was a big challenge. Mrs. Campbell gave us ideas on how to create our folders neatly without being a disaster. We used this and got my folders organized and working without any problems.</p>
<p>1.) Seeing the Coding done and organized. When things are organized, do you feel better? One of things I have noticed is that making things organized along the way is easier than after. You don’t have to go out of your way to organize your coding. When you turn off your computer it takes a while and wastes much more time than using that time to get something done. Instead you can switch the power button to the sleep so you can keep you files and you will get to the next class on time. This is such a useful strategy with saving time. </p>
<p>2.) Seeing the folders organized. Which this was a main event that I noticed because if you don’t feel right or feel stressed when getting things done, you’ll notice it’s a lot harder to get things done. If you enjoy your set up, you most likely will not stress when you’re getting things done on the computer. I got my files in the folders that are labeled by each class and color organization of the folders that we have, like blue green, red, yellow, orange, and purple. This way I can quickly put things in a folder that I will remember where it is instead of the scary downloads folder.  </p>
<p>These have both improved my ability to work and accomplish much more during the year and not get behind and forget to do it at home, in other ways using my time in class wisely. This helped me a lot with stress because it wasn’t stressful to be in a rush to get places. It is nice, easy, and worth it! That is how I have grown in coding and computer organization.</p>

					<p>I love traveling the World! I go on many trips to different countries and have visited most of the States. One of my most favorite places to go was New York City! I got to go see the One World Trade Center. It is the second tallest building in North America, and the Tallest in the United States. </p>
