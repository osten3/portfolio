				<h2> The City of Beavercreek's Savior </h2>
								<p>As the people in Beavercreek know, my family has been through a lot. I could go on about all the things that happened, but instead, I will tell you how we overcame some of these difficulties and how we turned them around to play to our benefit. My mother 2019 was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. As a teen in high school, this was rough for me. I didn't know how to feel, and I felt horrible. As people started giving to my family, I decided to give back! My family created the Beavercreek Tornado Network. If you want to learn more about this, hover over the image and read the back of the magazine.  </p>

				<h2> Key Club </h2>
								<p>Since the start of 8th grade, I have enjoyed taking time to help my community through Key Club. In Key Club, we help the community through events, money raising, and us! Not only this, but we collaborate with the school to hold events such as Prep rally and a bunch more. The picture below is an event that was held to pack food for children in Africa who needed nutrition.</p>

				<h2> R.A.C.E. Club </h2>
								<p>As a Senior I am currently a board member of the R.A.C.E. club we have at our school. The Racial Alliance Collaboration Effort is an amazing club that educated peers and teachers about race and ethnicity. So far this year, we have planned to collaborate with the whole school and ask them what their thoughts are about race and culture through our school. Leading up to how they feel will give us more information on what to do in the following months. We also have planned to talk about black history month and women's rights month. Below is a project that I worked on for the Club. Right now that image is in the process of being the new logo for the R.A.C.E. Club.</p>

				<h2> My Porfolio</h2>
								<p>In 6th grade, we started coding using Script, (An learner's coding tool.) During my time over covid, I began studying java and C++, to get a better understanding of other coding languages other than HTML. Since then and each summer, I have worked myself to learn a new type of coding. Whether it be a computer program, language, or just a command prompt, I always try to learn something new. The picture below is a bit of code I learned how to use over this past summer. I have implemented this into my portfolio, and that's why my portfolio is so special.</p>

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>			
					<div class="fakeimg27" style="height:400px;" ></div>
					<p>I love traveling the World! I go on many trips to different countries and have visited most of the States. One of my most favorite places to go was New York City! I got to go see the One World Trade Center. It is the second tallest building in North America, and the Tallest in the United States. </p>
