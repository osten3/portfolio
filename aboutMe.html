			<h2>My Most Interesting Experiences </h2>
				<h3> Key Club </h3>
								<p>Since the start of 6th grade I have enjoyed taking time to help my community through Key Club. In Key Club, I would help out with things that needed to be made, moved, and brought to people who are need. The picture below is an event that was held to pack food for children in Africa who needed nutrition.</p>

				<h3> R.A.C.E. Club </h3>
								<p>As a Senior I am currently a board member of the R.A.C.E. club we have at our school. The Racial Alliance Collaboration Effort is an amazing club that educated peers and teachers about race and ethnicity. So far this year, we have planned to collaborate with the whole school and ask them what there thoughts are about race and culture through our school. Leading up to how they feel will give us more information on what to do in the following months. We also have planned to talk about black history month, and women's rights month. </p>		
				<h3> Coding </h3>
								<p>In 6th grade we started coding using Script, (An learners coding tool.) During my time over covid I began studying java and C++, to get a better understanding of other coding languages other than html.</p>

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>			
					<div class="fakeimg27" style="height:400px;" ></div>
					<p>I love traveling the World! I go on many trips to different countries and have visited most of the States. One of my most favorite places to go was New York City! I got to go see the One World Trade Center. It is the second tallest building in North America, and the Tallest in the United States. </p>

							<h2>How can Music affect someones Daily Life?</h2>
								<p>The reason I chose this Driving Question is because I have put most of my life time into music, and it has imapcted my life more than anyone I know. Music has been a passion and i've always wondered about the secrets behind it.</p>
