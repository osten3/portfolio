					<h2>Going into 11th Grade!</h2>
						<h3> This was a tough year. Covid hit and there was a bunch of problems that occured throughout the entire year. This year was a journey, but helped me realize a lot of things that I wouldn't have known before. Below are three great reasons to how I grew during this 2020-2021 year and how I made my way through it. </h3>
							<div class="card">
								<h2>The Proposal Project</h2>
									<h5> Throughout my 11th grade year I didn't work on lot of projects due to covid-19. Since our school is about Project Based Learning, I found it much harder this year compared to my other years. We ended up not collaborating in our classes as much which was a struggle for me. Though I found a way out and saw how I grew in the aspect of collaboration. Since we came back in the 4th quarter I was able to communicate and collaborate on a project with my peers. The project that we worked on was the Proposal Project. The Proposal Project was to create an idea or proposal to give to the school and figure out how it can help our school. This porject was in our English class, so the main concept was about the writing and the experience of a proposal writer. We ended up getting to know a special speaker in the beginning. (Her name.) was a proposal writer for a company. She taught us the struggles and how to overcome them when writing. The biggest problem that she came across was working together with people. The main thing to fix that was to always keep on top of everything and let the group know. I ended up using these skills to my advantage when working with my peers. We constantly kept asking each other if we needed help and if there was any problems we could fix together. In our log books we would tell each other what we completed that day and how we felt about the situation. Overall it was a good succeses because we ended up getting a really good grade on the project. </h5>

									<h5>This will help me in the future to better work with people and know how to approach a situation. The biggest part of working together is collaboration because it is how you will communicate and work with people. Since I am trying to go for an engineering degree in college, I hope that these collaboration skills come in handy when working with other people. Below is our presentation to the DRSS administraition that we held.</h5>

					<h2>Researching Medical Feild Jobs</h2>
						<h5>In my Fitness assesment class, we did a project called the Medical Career Project. My group and I ended up researching Pharmicists because no other group did so. We were online due to Covid at the time, so we ended up not doing as much due to not being together in person. A huge problem that I have and a lot of other high schoolars is that we procatinate. Since the project was coming to end I realized that I had spent to much time messing around when I should have been working on the project. For the last day coming up to the presentation I worked really hard to communicate to my team members that we need to put most of our time into the presentation. Since the project was about researching, the requirements for the presentation was to have 30 words or less on each slide with a maximum of 10 slides. It was hard to remember all the information in such a little time. Trying to get all the information into the slides was difficult, but ended up doing alright. Next thing you know we were going 2nd on the presentations. We were worried that are work wouldn't be accepted and my team was going crazy. We ended working with what we had and ended up doing a great job. We got 88% on the project and it was worth almost all our grade. <h5>
						<h5> Looking back on the project I realized that I definitly shoudln't of procatinated and I should put my all into the project. The main thing that I learned from this was that I should set pirorities and set a time to do all the things that I need to do, like a schedule. This way I can plan out what happens and next time I won't be so nervous. Overall It was a great success. I feel like using these abilities in the future will help me not just overcome my problems, but help me get higher up in the real world. No one will except something that you didn't put your time into. Click the image below to start the presentation.</h5>

					<h2>Researching About Steroids</h2>
						<h5>In fitness assesment I had to proceed to attemp another big presentation. The presentation is researching about steroids. The first thing that came to mind was oh my we get to learn about steroids. The idea of this project was to get our classmates to understand the basics about steroids. We began off by choosing which steroid would be the best choice to learn about. Our groups was about Trenbolone. Our goal was to find 3 article describing about how the drug came into exsisting and what happens with the drug now. Knowing that I should not procastinate on this project like the last one I made myself work ahead on the project, so I can get it done with. I ended up not finding what I needed from online sources. I looked for up too 2 hours looking for the perfect source about the steroid that we had chosen. Since I worked on this early I was able to put a lot of information in the presentation. I ended up with over 1000 words and 15 slides. It was well worth working early on it too get it done. Though when I got to present the information to the class, I felt a lot more confident to what I has to say. I felt that I grew in the aspect of cofidence. Ever since I was a young lad I always has problems talking to people and being shy. Over the years I have gotten a bit better, but I never noticed a huge change. I was still nervous to go order food at some food restruant and I was still nervous to do a presentation. Since I knew so much information on the project, I ended up not looking at the board/presenation screen and ended up giving my full attention to the audience. I was proud of myself, and I felt like I grew In some aspect of readiness, cofindence and persistance. </h5>
						<h5> I feel like this will definitly help me in the future for, job interview, big presentations and just in life in general. I am a lot more confident in what I am doing if I really think about it. To me this was a huge impact in my life. Below is the Presentation I gave to my peers.

							<h2>What have I done outside of school this year?</h2>
								<p>Since we don't have school sports at the Dayton Regional STEM School, I have to go to my local school to try out for any sports. At the Beavercreek Highschool I made the varsity track team for hurtles. Though this was a tough time because I injured myself 2 days before we has meets. I ended up getting minor stress fractures in both my legs. Since then I have been recovering and working myself back up to track.  </p>
