						<p>I am Mason Osten! I am currently in 11th grade going into 12th. I love drawing, singing, listening to music, and surprisingly learning! A little more into detail about me, is that I have been playing the piano for 10 years. I practice everyday for about 2 hours. I also play the guitar. I just started guitar, so I am little new at it. I played soccer for 8 years, but took a break from soccer over 2018-2019. At my school we don't have sports, so I started going to my local school to be in sports. I have been on the Varisty track for 2 years at Beavercreek. 
						</p>
						<p>
						My family members include my Mom, my Dad, my brother, and my dog Roxie! Together we have a great time and love games. We love traveling and seeing new places. My mom has always been close to me as we get along so well. My mom is a flight attendant which grants my family the ability to fly free making it easier to see other cultures and seeing cool places. Art is a hobby we both have in common as were always using it to be as creative as we can.

						<div class="fakeimg0" style="height:100px;"><!--no--></div>
					<p>I love traveling the World! I go on many trips to different countries and have visited most of the States. One of my most favorite places to go was New York City! I got to go see the One World Trade Center. It is the second tallest building in North America, and the Tallest in the United States. </p>
