					<h2>Going into 10th Grade</h2>
						<h3> I am ready for 11th Grade because of all the things that I have been through in 10th. Some of the times were more difficult than others, but during that time I got to have a lot of fun. I learned camera skills, directory skills, writting skills, and overall better ways to make my life smarter than make more work for myself. Below is a few ways I have grown this year.</h3>
