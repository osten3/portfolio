					<h2>Driving Question: How can Music Impact Someone's Life?</h2>
					<h3> How has Music Impacted my Life? </h3>
							<p><em>“Music isn’t there to be your friend, but it’s there to guide you through your struggles.”</em></p>
						<p>I like to play instruments and learn about different ways to make music. Playing the piano for 11 years (Starting when I was five) created my whole life. I have started playing guitar, ukulele, violin, and messing around with vocals because I find music very extraordinary. Music has not just changed my life, but many others as it can be a coping mechanism. Along with that, I find music to bring people together, make moments more inspirational, create new dramatic scenes, and bring the aspect of hearing to another whole level. I like to research why these things happen so, I have been to many Broadway shows, music history museums, and many concerts. I then take this and create new music based on what I’ve learned. I haven’t produced any official music, but I would like to during college or after college. I listen to music frequently because it helps my right brain think more creatively and think outside the box. Whether I am studying, meditating, or pastimes, listening to music while doing these enhances my brain. Overall, I have been working with music for a long time, and it just has a connection to me like no other. Even though it seems generic, it has inspired me to continue my dreams and do what I want. </p>

						<h3> Research and Creations </h3>
						<p> I have done a lot of research into how music can make someone feel and it has got me thinking. When an artist creates music they have to figure out the emotion of the story before you can write the lyrics or music sheets. The reason behind this is because not every happy song can go to a group of sad notes. If you have ever played an insturment you have noticed how most love songs follow the chords of F, C, Am, and G. This is because back in the 1900, musicians figured out this type of chord progression leads a love story. To this day, this is still followed by many artist and it makes music as we know it. For example, Adele (A famous british singer for her award winning songs.) creates very sad songs due to her past memory relationships and other problematic issues. In her songs, she mostly uses Minor chord progressions or the chord Ebm. These types of notes are considered sad progressions and can be used to tell a story. In the bridge of her songs she usually adds a FM progression which is mostly known for Courage and Strenght. In my perspective this adds a story to a music piece rather than the lyrics. As if I can feel the story just from the tone. I have done many studies on this and found out there is a music theroy behind it. If you listen to songs with the chord GM, you are more likely to be happy after listening to it. 
						<!--Why can Music impact someone's life?
						“Music isn’t there to be your friend, but it’s there to guide you through your struggles.”
						Music gets to me a lot faster than most, which means I can predict a story of a piece. There are two variables that make up all music. Predictability, and Variability. It's either you're on one side of the scale or the other. Most are in the middle. When you get a song that you like, you tend to listen to it over and over again. This can be unhealthy listening. This is because when you listen to a certain music piece it makes you feel like it's more powerful than you If it is a love song or a sad song. Usually, music is made to be relaxing or encouraging. If neither, it can be stressful to listen to over and over. One example is Adele, Hello. This is because it is telling emotions of pain and forgetfulness. Well, We don't realize we are listening to a emotion, we will start to feel that emotion. That's why music can be unhealthy. -->

					<h1> Music Piece Examples</h1>
							<p>These pieces of music show how a different tune of an instrument and the style its played can tell a different emotion. The medium one is how music can be different by different techniques.</p>
							<!--Why can music impact you in a bad way? 
                            These pieces of music show how a different tune of an instrument and the style its played can tell a different emotion. The medium one is how music can be different by different techniques. The hard one is show-off-ing how you can remake a song from one emotion to the next. Listen to the link before then the one after. The more level the more meaning.-->
						<p>This is a cover done by Rafał Bienias and personally I believe it carrys different emotion through the music piece compared to the orginal. This piano piece follows each instrument in the orginal, but adds a mono-tone to the music.</p>

						<p>Seeing what the piano could do allow, you could just imagine what more than one instrument could do. Here is the version Two Steps of Hell released. The orginal piece uses different chords and notes for each instrument adding a story to the music piece. Some may say it is more dramatic, or exciting.</p>
